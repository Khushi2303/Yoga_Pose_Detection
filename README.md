## 📚 Overview
This project aims to detect and classify yoga poses in real time using **OpenPose**. It is designed to assist users in correcting their yoga poses with feedback and to promote proper posture during yoga practice.

## 🎯 Features
- **Pose Detection**: Identifies and tracks body landmarks for yoga poses.
- **Classification**: Recognizes up to 5 yoga poses and provides real-time results.
- **Feedback System**: Gives feedback to ensure correct posture.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for smooth interaction.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenPose**: Used for pose detection.
- **NumPy, Pandas**: Data processing and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization of results (if applicable).
